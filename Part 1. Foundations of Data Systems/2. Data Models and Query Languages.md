### Relational Model vs Document Model
#### Birth of NoSQL
* Need for scalability compared to what relational db's
* preference for FOSS
* Specialized query operations
* Less restrictive, allows for dynamic + expressive data model
#### The Object-Relational Mismatch
* Need an ORM that sits in between objects in app code and database model
	* app code -> ORM -> db model
* Example: Linkedin profile representation
	* Relational:
		* columns: uuid, first name, last name
		* one to many relationship for positions, education contact info using uuid as a foreign key
	* Document:
		* Everything in one document (no need for additional tables)
		* Better locality (no joins)
		* Represents a *tree* structure type of data model better
#### Many to One and Many to Many Relationships
* How to represent categorical data?
* Plain text is obviously needed for free text fields
* Benefits of having standardized lists instead:
	* consistency
	* avoids ambiguity (using Linkedin example, what if we represent one city different ways using free-text)
	* easy to update across the board
	* easy for localization
	* easy to search
* Given categorical data, should we store them as plain text strings or using an ID/Enum representation?
	* By using ID's, we reduce duplication inside of our records
		* The mapping from id -> categorical data is stored in one place
		* vs referring to categorical data in every record instance
	* Id's never need to change (has no meaning to us)
		* Only the thing the id needs to represent can be changed
		* We can easily make those changes in every record now by changing the mapping
			* (If we didn't have a mapping, it would increase # of writes)
		* This is *normalization*
* Normalization requires many to one relationships
* Data will become more interconnected as features as added
### Are Document Databases Repeating History?
#### The relational model (how it works)
* A relation (table) is a collection of tuples (rows)
* Query optimizer decides which parts of the query to execute in which order and which indexes to use
	* This is similar to the access path in a network/CODASYL model
### Relational vs Document Databases Today
* If data has a document-like structure (ex: a tree of one to many relationships), use a document
* if your application has many to many relationships, use relations
* For highly connected data, use a graph model
#### Schema Flexibility in the Document Model
* No schema in documents = clients have no guarantees to what fields the document can have
* Document databases are *schema-on-read* (structure is implicit and interpreted when reading)
* Relational databases are *schema-on-write* where schema is implicit and written data must conform to it
* Think runtime vs compile time
* If data is *heterogenous*, use document database
* If data is *homogenous*, schemas are advantageous
#### Data Locality for Queries
* If app needs the entire document, then obviously use document databases
	* Only applies when you need large portions of the document at the same time
* However, writes will rewrite the entire document
	* So try to keep documents small
### Query Languages for Data
* SQL is *declarative* query language
* IMS and CODASYL is *imperative* 
* Recall:
	* imperative = tell the computer to do things step by step
	* declarative = specify the pattern you want + conditions, but now how you want to achieve it
* Declarative:
	* Pros:
		* concise, abstract
		* allows you to make optimizations behind the scenes without changing the query language
		* allow for parallel executions
* Imperative:
	* Cons:
		* Cannot do parallel execution easily b/c there is an order of instructions (race conditions)
#### Declarative Queries on the Web
* Declarative:
	* Example: applying style to all child element under a tag in CSS, XSL
	* Pros:
		* underlying CSS implementation can be improved and it won't affect our code
			* We won't have to change anything
		* Simple to use and read
* Imperative:
	* Example: iterate over all elements in the child and apply the style one by one
	* Cons:
		* Longer and harder to understand
		* To remove a style, you have to reload the page
		* To make improvements with the performance, you need to rewrite the code
#### MapReduce Querying
* MapReduce is a programming model for processing large amounts of data in bulk across many machines
* Not declarative nor imperative
* Logic of query i expressed w/ snippets of code which are called repeatedly
* based on map and reduce in functional programming
* MongoDB example:
```
db.observations.mapReduce(
	function map() {
		var year = this.observationTimestamp.getFullYear();
		var month = this.observationTimestamp.getMonth() + 1;
		emit(year + "-" + month, this.animals)
	},
	function reduce(key, values) {
		return Array.sum(values);
	},
	{
		query: { family: "Sharks" },
		out: "monthlySharkReport"
	}
)
```
Notes
* map is called once for every document that matches the query
* map emits a key and a value
* key-value pairs w/ the same key are grouped together
	* Reduce function is called once for the ones w/ the same key-value pair
* Final output is written to the "out" place
Limitations of map and reduce
* Can only use the data that is passed to them as input
* Cannot have any side effects
* Hard to write two carefully coordinated JavaScript functions

### Graph-Like Data Models
* If your data is interconnected and has many many to many relationships use a graph
* Graphs are not limited to homogenous data
	* Ex:
		* Facebook has a single graph with different types of vertices and edges
			* Vertices = people, locations, events, checkins, etc.
			* Edges:
				* people who are friends, checkins in specific locations, who commented on what post, etc.
#### Property Graphs
* Vertex has:
	* uuid
	* outgoing edges
	* incoming edges
	* properties (key-value pairs)
* Edge has:
	* uuid
	* vertex where the edge starts (the tail vertex)
	* vertex where the edge ends (the head vertex)
	* label to describe relationship
	* properties (key-value pairs)
* Features of model:
	* A vertex can have an edge connecting it with any other vertex (allows for type-mismatches)
	* Can traverse the graph quickly
	* Can use diff labels for diff relationships = allow for storage of diff kinds of info in 1 graph
### Cypher Query Language
* Cypher is a declarative query language for property graphs
* Query using pattern match esque syntax
* Recall:
	* don't need to pecify execution details when writing the query
	* query optimizer handles picking the efficient strategy to run the query
### Graph Queries in SQL
* Sps we represent graph data in a relational database
* Problem:
	* Usually we know how many joins we have to do before hand
	* In a graph traversal, this may be unknown
* Fix:
	* recursive common table expressions
	* confusing
	* Very convoluted to do this in SQL compared to Cypher
### Triple-Stores and SPARQL
* Triple-store is similar to property graph model but with different terms to describe the same concepts
* Info is sorted in three part statements:
	* (subject, predicate, object)
	* Ex: (Jim, likes, bananas)
* Subject = vertex
* Object can be one of two things
	* value in a primitive datatype
		* string, number
		* In this case, think of predicate and object as a key-value pair
		* Ex:
			* (lucy, age, 33)
			* {age:33}
	* another vertex in the graph
		* in this case, the predicate is the edge
		* subject = tail vertex
		* object = head vertex
#### Semantic Web
* Triple-store is independent of semantic web, though it is heavily mentioned when looking it up
* Semantic web:
	* idea that websites should publish information as machine-readable data for computers to read
	* goal: allow websites to publish data in a consistent format, so data from different websites can be combined into a web of data
		* RDF (Resource Description Framework) - spec to accomplish the above
#### The RDF Format
* Turtle is a human readable format for RDF (used in examples in DDIA for triple store)
* RDF can be in XML
* In RDF:
	* subject, predicate, object are URI's 
#### The SPARQL Query Language
* SPARQL is a query language for triple stores using RDF data model
	* Cypher came after this
	* Has Cypher-like pattern matching
### The Foundation: Datalog
* Datalog is older than SPARQL or Cypher
* Foundation of query languages
	* Cascalog is a Datalog implementation for querying large datasets in Hadoop
* Similar to triple-store model:
	* predicate(subject, object)
* Query syntax:
	* Define rules
		* Tell the database about new predicates
		* These predicates aren't in the database, dervied from data or other rules
		* Rules can refer to other rules
	* In rules, words that start w/ uppercase letters are variables
		* Ex: name(Location, Name)
		* matches name(namerica, 'North America')
		* Variables are linked i.e., Location=namerica
	* Rule applies iff there is a match for all predicates on the right hand side of the :- operator
	* If it applies, it is as if the lefthand side of the :- is added to the db (the predicate)
